**1. Overview**

This document outlines the responsibilities of each component within the Autonomous Coding Ecosystem. It’s designed to provide a clear understanding of the system’s architecture and facilitate collaboration among developers.

**2. Component Breakdown & Responsibilities**

| Component Name          | Description                               | Key Responsibilities                                                              | Technologies (Example) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Archon (MCP Server)** | Central Orchestrator & Knowledge Base     | - Task Management - Agent Assignment - Knowledge Retrieval - API Gateway - Monitoring & Logging - User Authentication | Python/Flask, PostgreSQL |
| **CodeGenerationAgent** | Specialized Agent for Code Creation      | - Generating code snippets based on task descriptions - Formatting code - Providing code examples - Integrating with version control systems | Python/Flask, gRPC |
| **TestingAgent**         | Specialized Agent for Automated Testing   | - Generating unit tests - Running tests - Reporting test results - Integrating with testing frameworks | Python/Flask, gRPC |
| **DocumentationAgent**   | Specialized Agent for Documentation Generation | - Generating documentation based on code and task descriptions - Formatting documentation - Integrating with documentation tools | Python/Flask, gRPC |
| **AnalysisAgent**        | Specialized Agent for Static Code Analysis | - Performing static code analysis - Identifying potential bugs and vulnerabilities - Generating reports | Python/Flask, gRPC |
| **User Interface (UI)** | Web-based Interface for Interaction      | - Providing a user-friendly interface for creating and managing tasks - Displaying task status - Allowing users to interact with the system | React/JavaScript, HTML/CSS |
| **KnowledgeBase**        | Central Repository for Knowledge Items   | - Storing and retrieving knowledge items (code snippets, documentation, examples) - Providing a search interface - Supporting different knowledge item types | PostgreSQL, gRPC |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | System-wide Monitoring & Logging          | - Collecting metrics and logs from all components - Providing alerts for critical events - Supporting debugging and troubleshooting | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack |

**3. Communication & Interactions**

*   **gRPC:** Used for high-performance communication between components.
*   **API Gateway (Archon):**  Provides a single entry point for all API requests.
*   **Event-Driven Communication:**  Utilized for asynchronous communication between components.

**4. Future Considerations**

*   Adding more specialized agents for specific coding tasks.
*   Implementing a more sophisticated knowledge graph.
