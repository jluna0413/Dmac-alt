**Database Technology:** PostgreSQL (Chosen for its robustness, scalability, and support for JSON data)

**1. Overview**

This document defines the data models and schemas for the Autonomous Coding Ecosystem. It outlines the structure of the data stored in the PostgreSQL database, ensuring consistency and facilitating efficient data access and manipulation.

**2. Data Models**

We’ll define the following key data models:

*   **Task:** Represents a coding task assigned to an agent.
*   **Agent:** Represents a specialized agent within the ecosystem.
*   **KnowledgeItem:** Represents a piece of knowledge (e.g., code snippet, documentation) stored in the knowledge graph.
*   **User:** Represents a user interacting with the system.
*   **Project:** Represents a software project being developed.

**3. Schema Definitions (PostgreSQL)**

**3.1. Task Table**

*   `task_id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the task.
*   `project_id` (UUID, Foreign Key):  Links the task to a specific project.
*   `agent_id` (UUID, Foreign Key):  Links the task to the agent assigned to it.
*   `task_description` (Text):  The description of the task.
*   `status` (Enum: ‘pending’, ‘running’, ‘completed’, ‘cancelled’): The current status of the task.
*   `creation_timestamp` (Timestamp):  The timestamp when the task was created.
*   `completion_timestamp` (Timestamp, Nullable): The timestamp when the task was completed.
*   `priority` (Integer):  Priority level of the task (e.g., 1-5).

**3.2. Agent Table**

*   `agent_id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the agent.
*   `name` (Text):  The name of the agent.
*   `description` (Text):  The description of the agent.
*   `type` (Enum: ‘code_generation’, ‘testing’, ‘documentation’, ‘analysis’): The type of agent.
*   `configuration` (JSONB):  Agent-specific configuration settings.

**3.3. KnowledgeItem Table**

*   `knowledge_id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the knowledge item.
*   `type` (Enum: ‘code_snippet’, ‘documentation’, ‘example’): The type of knowledge item.
*   `content` (Text): The content of the knowledge item.
*   `creation_timestamp` (Timestamp): The timestamp when the knowledge item was created.
*   `last_updated_timestamp` (Timestamp): The timestamp when the knowledge item was last updated.

**3.4. User Table**

*   `user_id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the user.
*   `username` (Text): User's username.
*   `email` (Text): User's email address.
*   `password` (Text): Hashed password.
*   `role` (Enum: ‘admin’, ‘developer’, ‘user’): User's role.

**3.5. Project Table**

*   `project_id` (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for the project.
*   `name` (Text): Project name.
*   `description` (Text): Project description.
*   `repository_url` (Text): URL to the project's repository.

**4. Data Types Summary**

| Field Name           | Data Type      | Description                               |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| UUID                  | UUID           | Universally Unique Identifier             |
| Text                  | Text           | String data                               |
| Integer               | Integer        | Whole number                               |
| Boolean               | Boolean        | True or False                              |
| Timestamp             | Timestamp      | Date and time                               |
| JSONB                 | JSONB          | JSON data                                  |
| Enum                  | Enum           | Predefined set of values                   |

**5. Relationships**

*   One-to-many relationship between Project and Task.
*   One-to-many relationship between Agent and Task.
*   One-to-many relationship between User and Task.
*   One-to-many relationship between KnowledgeItem and Agent.

**6. Future Considerations**

*   Adding indexes to frequently queried fields.
*   Implementing data validation constraints.

**Next Steps:** We will create database schemas in PostgreSQL based on these definitions.  We will also implement data validation constraints and indexes.
