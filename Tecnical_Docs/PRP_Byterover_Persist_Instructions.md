# Persisting PRP Plan to Byterover MCP

If the Byterover MCP server is available, follow these steps to persist the project and tasks so other agents and tools can reference them.

1. Create the project
- Call `mcp_archon_create_project` with:
  - title: "Autonomous Coding Ecosystem"
  - description: Short description (copy from PRP-001)

2. Create tasks
- For each entry in `PRP_Task_List.md`, call `mcp_archon_create_task` with:
  - project_id: (from step 1)
  - title: TASK-xxx title
  - description: full task description
  - assignee: agent name (e.g., "AI IDE Agent")
  - task_order: priority (higher = earlier)
  - sources: list of source docs (e.g., `Tecnical_Docs/Product Requirements Plan (PRP)`)

3. Save implementation plan snapshot
- Call `mcp_archon_create_version` with:
  - project_id: project id
  - field_name: "docs"
  - content: [ { "id": "PRP-Impl-Plan-1", "title": "PRP Implementation Plan", "content": <plan markdown> } ]

Notes on failure handling
- If the MCP call fails, store the plan locally (this repository) and retry when the MCP server is reachable.
- Keep the `Byterover_Memory_Entry_Template.md` handy for entries that record progress and key decisions.
