# PRP Implementation Plan â€” Autonomous Coding Ecosystem

Source: `Product Requirements Plan (PRP)` (PRP-001)
Date: 2025-09-03
Author: AI Engineer Agent

## Goal
Implement the core components defined in PRP-001 to deliver an Autonomous Coding Ecosystem: agent orchestration, task management, code generation, MCP communication, knowledge base, integrations, and reporting.

## Scope
- MVP: Task Management, Agent Orchestration (Archon + CodeGen/Testing/Docs agents), Basic MCP communication, Knowledge Base, and simple integrations with Git and VS Code.
- Languages: Python (primary), JavaScript (secondary)
- Persistence: PostgreSQL (metadata), Redis (queues/cache)

## UPDATED MILESTONES (Post MCP-Context-Forge Completion)
1. **Foundation Completion (Week 1)**: Database schema, CI testing infrastructure, agent scaffolds
2. **Mobile-Agent-V3 Implementation (Weeks 2-4)**: Multi-agent orchestration, dynamic GUI generation, mobile task synchronization
3. **Enterprise Scaling (Weeks 5-6)**: Unlimited agent deployment, workflow automation, advanced analytics
4. **Production Deployment (Week 7)**: End-to-end tests, security hardening, enterprise release

## Strategic Implementation Sequence
**Phase 1: Complete Foundation Components (4-5 days)**
- [ ] TASK-002: Database Schema & Migrations (3-4 days)
- [ ] TASK-011: CI Sanity & ENV Setup completion (1-2 days)
- [ ] TASK-003: Agent Scaffolds completion (1-2 days)

**Phase 2: Mobile-Agent-V3 Implementation (60-70% productivity gains)**
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration engine
- [ ] Dynamic GUI generation system
- [ ] Mobile task synchronization
- [ ] Intelligent resource allocation
- [ ] Autonomous task scaling

## Proposed Technologies
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI
- Messaging / MCP: Enhanced REST-over-HTTP with JWT, Redis streams for async messaging
- Worker agents: Python async processes (asyncio) with mobile agent extensions
- Database: PostgreSQL with advanced indexing for agent state management
- Caching/Queue: Redis with persistent queues for mobile synchronization
- Frontend: Context-aware adaptive GUIs, mobile-responsive React/Vite
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with mobile deployment pipelines

## Component Responsibilities (high level)
- Archon: Orchestrates agents, routes MCP messages, manages plans
- CodeGenerationAgent: Generates code artifacts per task, enforces styles
- TestingAgent: Produces unit and integration tests, runs test harness
- DocumentationAgent: Produces docs, updates knowledge base
- DB / Knowledge Base: Stores tasks, plans, snippets, ADRs

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
- Create & track tasks via API
- Archon receives a task and delegates to agents
- CodeGenerationAgent produces runnable code for simple tasks (e.g., REST endpoint)
- TestingAgent runs tests and reports results
- DocumentationAgent stores docs into the knowledge base
- Basic CI checks (lint, tests) pass

## Risks & Challenges
- MCP spec completeness and security requirements
- Scaling agent communication and ensuring idempotency
- Ensuring generated code quality and test coverage
- Access control and data privacy in the knowledge base

## Initial Implementation Tasks (see task list)
Tasks are tracked in `PRP_Task_List.md`. When Byterover MCP is available we will persist this plan via Byterover.

## How to persist this plan to Byterover (when MCP is reachable)
- Create project via Byterover API: `byterover-create-project` (or call `mcp_archon_create_project` with title and description)
- For each task, call `mcp_archon_create_task` with project_id, title, description, assignee, and sources.
