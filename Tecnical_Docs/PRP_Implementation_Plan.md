# PRP Implementation Plan — Autonomous Coding Ecosystem

Source: `Product Requirements Plan (PRP)` (PRP-001)
Date: 2025-09-03
Author: AI Engineer Agent

## Goal
Implement the core components defined in PRP-001 to deliver an Autonomous Coding Ecosystem: agent orchestration, task management, code generation, MCP communication, knowledge base, integrations, and reporting.

## Scope
- MVP: Task Management, Agent Orchestration (Archon + CodeGen/Testing/Docs agents), Basic MCP communication, Knowledge Base, and simple integrations with Git and VS Code.
- Languages: Python (primary), JavaScript (secondary)
- Persistence: PostgreSQL (metadata), Redis (queues/cache)

## Milestones
1. Project setup & infra (repo structure, CI, DB schema) — 1 week
2. Core MCP messaging layer & Archon skeleton — 2 weeks
3. Task Management API & UI (basic) — 2 weeks
4. CodeGenerationAgent (Python) + style enforcement — 3 weeks
5. TestingAgent + auto-test harness — 2 weeks
6. DocumentationAgent + knowledge base integration — 1 week
7. Integrations (Git, VS Code) & Reporting — 2 weeks
8. End-to-end tests, security, and release — 2 weeks

## Proposed Technologies
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI
- Messaging / MCP: gRPC or REST-over-HTTP with mutual TLS (initially REST with JWT) and a lightweight broker for async (Redis streams)
- Worker agents: Python async processes (asyncio) or containerized microservices
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Caching/Queue: Redis
- Frontend (if needed): React / Vite
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Component Responsibilities (high level)
- Archon: Orchestrates agents, routes MCP messages, manages plans
- CodeGenerationAgent: Generates code artifacts per task, enforces styles
- TestingAgent: Produces unit and integration tests, runs test harness
- DocumentationAgent: Produces docs, updates knowledge base
- DB / Knowledge Base: Stores tasks, plans, snippets, ADRs

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
- Create & track tasks via API
- Archon receives a task and delegates to agents
- CodeGenerationAgent produces runnable code for simple tasks (e.g., REST endpoint)
- TestingAgent runs tests and reports results
- DocumentationAgent stores docs into the knowledge base
- Basic CI checks (lint, tests) pass

## Risks & Challenges
- MCP spec completeness and security requirements
- Scaling agent communication and ensuring idempotency
- Ensuring generated code quality and test coverage
- Access control and data privacy in the knowledge base

## Initial Implementation Tasks (see task list)
Tasks are tracked in `PRP_Task_List.md`. When Byterover MCP is available we will persist this plan via Byterover.

## How to persist this plan to Byterover (when MCP is reachable)
- Create project via Byterover API: `byterover-create-project` (or call `mcp_archon_create_project` with title and description)
- For each task, call `mcp_archon_create_task` with project_id, title, description, assignee, and sources.
