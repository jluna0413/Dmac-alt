Product Requirements Plan (PRP)

Project Name: Autonomous Coding Ecosystem Version: 1.0 Date: October 26, 2023 Product Owner: AI Engineer @Agent Document ID: PRP-001

1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Autonomous Coding Ecosystem – a system designed to streamline and automate the software development process through intelligent agent orchestration and model context protocol (MCP) communication. This ecosystem aims to reduce developer friction, improve productivity, and enable faster innovation.

2. Goals & Objectives

Primary Goal: To create a self-managing coding environment that reduces the manual effort involved in software development tasks.
Objectives:
Automate repetitive coding tasks (e.g., code generation, testing, documentation).
Enable seamless collaboration between developers and agents.
Provide a centralized knowledge base and task management system.
Improve developer productivity by 20% within the first six months of deployment.
3. Target Users

Primary Users: Software Developers (across various programming languages and platforms)
Secondary Users: DevOps Engineers, Technical Writers, Project Managers
4. User Stories

These are written from the perspective of the user.

As a Developer, I want to be able to submit a high-level task description (e.g., “Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication”) and have the system automatically generate the necessary code, tests, and documentation.
As a Developer, I want to be able to track the progress of my tasks in real-time and receive notifications when tasks are completed or require my attention.
As a Developer, I want to be able to easily access and share code snippets, documentation, and best practices within the system.
As a Developer, I want to be able to integrate the system with my existing development tools (e.g., IDEs, version control systems).
As a DevOps Engineer, I want to be able to monitor the health and performance of the system and receive alerts when issues arise.
As a Technical Writer, I want the system to automatically generate documentation for my code and projects.
As a Project Manager, I want to be able to track the progress of all projects and tasks in a centralized dashboard.
5. Functional Requirements

Task Management:
Ability to create, assign, and track tasks.
Task prioritization and dependency management.
Real-time task status updates.
Code Generation:
Automatic code generation based on task descriptions.
Support for multiple programming languages (initially Python, JavaScript, and potentially others).
Code style enforcement.
MCP Communication:
Seamless communication between agents and Archon via MCP.
Secure data exchange.
Knowledge Base:
Centralized repository for code snippets, documentation, and best practices.
Search functionality.
Integration with Existing Tools:
Support for popular IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ).
Integration with version control systems (Git).
Reporting & Analytics:
Generate reports on developer productivity, task completion rates, and system performance.
6. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The system should respond quickly to user requests and handle a large number of concurrent users.
Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate future growth.
Security: The system should be secure and protect sensitive data.
Reliability: The system should be reliable and available.
Usability: The system should be easy to use and intuitive.
7. Release Criteria

All functional requirements must be implemented and tested.
All non-functional requirements must be met.
The system must pass all security tests.
User documentation must be complete and accurate.
8. Future Considerations (Roadmap)

Support for additional programming languages.
Integration with more development tools.
Advanced analytics and reporting.
AI-powered code completion and debugging.
