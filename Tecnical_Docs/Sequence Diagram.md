**1. Overview**

These sequence diagrams illustrate key interactions within the system, focusing on the core workflow of a task – from initiation to completion.  They will help developers understand the dependencies and communication patterns between components.

**2. Diagrams**

**2.1. Task Creation & Agent Assignment**

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Archon" as Archon
participant "CodeGenerationAgent" as Agent

User -> Archon: Creates Task (Task Description)
Archon -> Agent: Assigns Task
Agent -> Archon: Reports Task Assignment
Archon -> User: Confirms Task Assignment
@enduml
```

*   **Description:** This diagram illustrates the process of a user creating a task and the system assigning it to a suitable agent.

**2.2. Task Execution & Knowledge Retrieval**

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Archon" as Archon
participant "CodeGenerationAgent" as Agent
participant "KnowledgeBase" as KB

User -> Archon: Requests Task Execution
Archon -> KB: Retrieves Relevant Knowledge
Agent -> Archon: Requests Knowledge
Archon -> KB: Retrieves Knowledge
Agent -> Archon: Executes Task
Archon -> Agent: Sends Task Results
@enduml
```

*   **Description:** This diagram illustrates the process of an agent executing a task, potentially retrieving relevant knowledge from the knowledge base.

**2.3. Task Completion & Reporting**

```plantuml
@startuml
participant User
participant "Archon" as Archon
participant "CodeGenerationAgent" as Agent

User -> Archon: Checks Task Status
Archon -> Agent: Sends Task Results
Agent -> Archon: Reports Task Completion
Archon -> User: Confirms Task Completion
@enduml
```

*   **Description:** This diagram illustrates the process of an agent completing a task and reporting its status to the user and the Archon.

**3. Notes & Considerations**

*   These diagrams represent simplified workflows.  More complex scenarios will involve additional interactions and components.
*   The specific messages exchanged between components will be defined in the API specifications.
*   These diagrams will be updated as the system evolves.
