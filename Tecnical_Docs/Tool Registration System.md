# Improved Tool Registration System for MCPControl

## Overview

The MCPControl module has been enhanced with an improved tool registration system to address the issue of redundant registration calls. This document explains the changes made and provides guidelines for implementing tools using the new registration pattern.

## Problem Statement

The previous implementation suffered from these issues:

1. **Redundant Registration**: Tools were being registered multiple times due to recursive imports and no tracking mechanism.
2. **Manual Registration**: Tools had to be explicitly registered with the registry, leading to repetitive code.
3. **No Module Tracking**: The system did not track which modules had been registered, causing duplicate registrations.
4. **Distributed Registration**: Registration code was spread across multiple locations, making it difficult to maintain.

## Solution

The improved registration system addresses these issues through:

1. **Tool Registration Tracking**: A set of registered tool names prevents duplicate registrations.
2. **Module Import Tracking**: A set of imported module paths prevents recursive imports.
3. **Decorator-Based Registration**: A `@tool` decorator simplifies tool definitions and handles registration.
4. **Centralized Control**: All registrations are managed by the MCPControl instance.

## Implementation Details

### MCPControl Class

The MCPControl class has been enhanced with:

- `registered_tools`: A set that keeps track of registered tool names
- `_module_imports_attempted`: A set that tracks which modules have been registered
- `register_tools_from_module`: A new method that registers tools from a module only once

### Tool Decorator

A new `@tool` decorator has been added to simplify tool definitions:

```python
@tool(
    name="example_hello",
    description="Get a hello message",
    parameters={},
    tags=["example"]
)
def hello_handler(params):
    return {"message": "Hello!"}
```

The decorator automatically registers the tool with the MCPControl registry when the module is imported.

### Module Registration

Modules now define a `register_module()` function that is called by the MCPControl instance:

```python
def register_module():
    """Register this module with the system."""
    logger.info("Registering Example module")
    tools.register_tools()
```

The MCPControl instance ensures this function is called only once per module.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Tool Developers

1. **Use the Decorator**: Always use the `@tool` decorator to define tools.
2. **Organize Tools**: Group related tools in a `tools.py` file within your module.
3. **Define Parameters**: Clearly define the parameters schema in the decorator.
4. **Add Tags**: Use tags to categorize your tools for easier discovery.

### For Module Developers

1. **Create `register_module()`**: Define a function that initializes your module.
2. **Import Tool Modules**: Import your tools module at the top of your `__init__.py`.
3. **Initialize Resources**: Use `register_module()` to set up any required resources.
4. **Avoid Manual Registration**: Let the decorator handle tool registration.

## Example Implementation

See the example module in `src/mcp_server/modules/example/` for a complete implementation using these best practices.

## Benefits

The improved registration system provides these benefits:

1. **Simplified Development**: The decorator pattern makes it easier to define and register tools.
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Tools are registered only once, regardless of import patterns.
3. **Better Maintainability**: Centralized registration makes it easier to manage tools.
4. **Cleaner Code**: Less boilerplate code for tool registration.

## Future Improvements

1. **Tool Versioning**: Add support for tool versioning to handle API changes.
2. **Tool Dependencies**: Implement a system for handling tool dependencies.
3. **Hot Reloading**: Support for hot reloading of tools during development.
4. **Tool Categories**: Enhanced categorization and discovery of tools.
