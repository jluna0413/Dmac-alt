## Summary
Implemented the MCP adapter core with offline fallback and remote-call wrappers. Added unit tests for both offline and mocked-remote modes.

## Files changed
- src/mcp_adapter/client.py
- tests/test_mcp_adapter.py
- tests/test_mcp_adapter_remote.py

## Details
Added ByteroverClient with methods: byterover_save_implementation_plan, byterover_update_plan_progress, byterover_store_knowledge, byterover_retrieve_knowledge, byterover_create_project, byterover_create_task, byterover_retrieve_active_plans. Offline mode writes JSON files to a configurable directory.

For runtime behavior and testing notes see: `Tecnical_Docs/Byterover_Client_Behavior.md`.

## Tests / Evidence
- Unit tests pass locally (offline + mocked remote): see tests/test_mcp_adapter.py and tests/test_mcp_adapter_remote.py

## Next steps
- Integrate authenticated remote calls and retry/backoff policies.
- Add integration tests with a local MCP test server when available.
